** Shifting gears
Today begins our study of new techniques of integration.  After
today's class, you be able to integrate something that looks like
\[
\int\limits_{}^{} xe^x\,dx \]
which currently we don't know how to handle.

The secret to integrating this and many other functions lies in a
technique called _\hspace{1in}_.  
Integration by parts is the integration rule that corresponds to the
product rule for differentiation, so let's remind ourselves of the
product rule. 

** The product rule
If \(f \left( x \right) \) and \(g \left( x \right) \) are
differentiable functions, then so is \(f \left( x \right)g \left( x
\right) \) and
\[
\hspace{1in} \]

If we integrate both sides of this, we get:
\[
\hspace{1in}\]
Rearranging this, we have one way of writing the integration by parts
formula:
\[
\hspace{1in}\]

** The product rule
The way this is usually written is as follows:
\[
\hspace{1in} \]
Matching corresponding pieces with the slide before, we have
\[
\hspace{1in}\]
with
\[
\hspace{1in} \]
This is not a _\hspace{1in}_.

This is simply a quick way to write out integration by parts.

** Example
Find
\[
\int\limits_{}^{} xe^x\,dx \]
\vspace{10in}

** Example

** How do I pick \(u \) and \(dv \)?
A very natural question comes up when learning integration by parts:
Which function should we make \(u \) and which one we should make \(dv
\)?

Some books teach the following acronym: LIATE.

How do we use this acronym?  When you're deciding which function to
make \(u \), you're going to choose the function that appears furthest
to the left in the acronym:
- L :: 
- I ::
- A :: 
- T ::
- E :: 

** Example
Find
\[
\int\limits_{}^{} \ln (x)\,dx \]

Find
\[
\int\limits_{}^{} x^2 \sin \left( x \right)\,dx \]
