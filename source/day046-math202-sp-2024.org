** A reminder of Taylor Series

Here's what we talked about last time!  Suppose \(f(x)\) is a function that
has as many derivatives at the point \(a\) as we desire.  Then the _\hspace*{1in}_ for
\(f\) centered at \(a\) is given by

\vspace{1in}

If \(a = 0\), we call the series the _\hspace*{1in}_ for \(f\).

** Example
Find the Maclaurin series for the function \(f(x) = e^x.\)  Also find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence.
\vspace{10in}

** Example

** Example
Find the Taylor series centered at \(a=1\) for the function \(f(x) =
\ln \left( x \right)\). Also find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence.

** Taylor Polynomials and the Remainder

The partial sums associated with a Taylor series is called a _\hspace*{1in}_.

:END:

If \(f\) has \(n\) derivatives at \(x = a\), then the \(n\)th Taylor Polynomial for \(f\) at \(a\)
is
\[
p_n(x) = \hspace{2in}\]
We also define the \(n\)th remainder as
\[
R_n(x) = \hspace{2in}\]

** Example
Find \(p_0(x),p_1(x),p_2(x),\) and \(p_3(x)\) at \(a = 0\) for the
function \(f(x) = e^x.\)  Also write down the corresponding remainders.

\vspace{10in}

** Example

** Example
Find \(p_2(x)\) at \(a = -1\) for the function \(f(x) = \sqrt{5+x}\). What is the correponding remainder?

** Example

** Another way to write the remainder term
Let's finish up by seeing another way to write the remainder term
\(R_n(x)\) for a function \(f\) that has \(n+1\) derivatives at the
point \(a\).
